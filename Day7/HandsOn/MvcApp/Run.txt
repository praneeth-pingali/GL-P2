Run the application in Visual Studio (Ctrl + F5).
Open the browser and test these URLs:
/ → Loads FirstController → Index1()
/first/index2 → "This is Index2 from FirstController"
/second/index3 → "This is Index3 from SecondController"
/end → Terminates middleware and displays "Terminating request at /end"
/hello → Displays "Hello from middleware!", then processes controllers
